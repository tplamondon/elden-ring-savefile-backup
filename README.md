# elden-ring-savefile-backup

To build the exe yourself

- pip install pyinstaller
- pyinstaller er-savemanager.py

Otherwise, just run `python er-savemanager.py`
Follow the onscreen instructions

This assumes you're using a windows PC, where the Elden ring saves are stored in %appdata%

Backups will be stored where the program executable is downloaded

To my knowledge, python does not need to be installed on a computer who downloads the exe file
